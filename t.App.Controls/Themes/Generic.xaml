    Theme-level dictionaries are stored in a subfolder named Themes. 
    The files in the Themes folder correspond to themes. 
    For example, you might have Aero.NormalColor.xaml, Luna.NormalColor.xaml, Royale.NormalColor.xaml, and so on. 
    You can also have a file named Generic.xaml. 
    When the system looks for a resource at the themes level, it first looks for it in the theme-specific file and then looks for it in Generic.xaml.
